Docker: A containerization platform that allows developers to package and distribute applications and their dependencies in 
isolated containers 

Docker Enginer: Core component of docker which is responsible for running containers and managing docker images

Docker Container: It is a lightweight executable package which contains all the packages required to run a piece of software,
including code, runtime, libraries and system tools 

docker ps: displays list of running docker containers

Dockerfile: It contains instruction to create a docker file, it contains cli commands in a file used to setup the entire
evironment and application setup

Docker Image: A snapshot of an application and its dependencies (blueprint)

docker build: Creates a docker image based on the instructions provided in the dockerfile

docker rmi: Remove docker image

docker-compose up: Builds and starts containers as defined in the docker-compose.yml config 

docker prune: Remove unused images, containers and networds to free up space 

Kubernetes is used to orchestrate large scale docker container deployments

docker exec: Lets you open an interactive shell session inside a running container 

Port bindings: Assigning internal ports to external ports (mapping b/w them)

Docker Compose: Simplifies running multiple docker containers applications as it contains all the configuration details in a 
docker-compose.yml file

docker inspect: Shows detailed information about a container

The docker daemon is responsible for managing docker containers, images and network resources on the host machine

Docker Engine, Docker CLI and Docker daemon are the key components of docker architecture
