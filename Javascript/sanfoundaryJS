Javascript is a scripting language made for making the website interactive, it can be used both at the client side and the server side 

JS is not an object oriented language but it is an object based language

Closure: It the criteria in which a function has access to all the variables and functions present in its lexical environment

var js = (function(x) {return x*x;}(10)); : This code snippet will reun perfectly, in js we can define and execute a function immediately 

JS is a dynamic, loosely typed language. Variables in JS arent tied to any specific value type, and each variable can be assigned or reassigned to values of all types

We can embed JS code in HTML using one of the following ways 
- Using script tag and writing the code in between
- Importing an external js file 
- Writing JS code while working with event handler attributes in HTML 
- From a URL using the special javascript: protocol

All client-side javascript features and api are handled by the browsers window object 

JS employs lexical scoping which means that the variable scope of any function would be the scope when the function is being defined rather than when the function 
is being invoked or called

JS engine is used to interpret JS, it is used to parse JS and run it on web pages

All object instances have a constructor property that points to the constructor function that created them. A custom constructor is a constructor which requires no
arguments and is created automatically by the compiler at the time of object creation 

The window objects onerror property acts as a event handler, and is triggered when a JS problem occurs 

In JS diving by 0 does'nt give an error it just returns Infinity or -Infinity and 0/0 gives NaN (not a number)
